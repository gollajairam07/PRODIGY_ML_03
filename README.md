🔍 Task-03: Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

Key Highlights:

🐱 Utilized SVM for robust and accurate image classification.
🐶 Processed and prepared the Kaggle dataset for optimal model performance.
🧠 Fine-tuned the model to improve classification accuracy.
This project enhanced my understanding of SVMs and their practical applications in image recognition.
